Overview
-------------------
This main purpose of this project is to test embxx library and demonstrate its 
usage on Raspberry Pi as bare metal platform.

What you need
-------------------
1. Git
2. CMake
3. Cross compiling gcc v4.7 toolchain or greater

How to compile
-------------------
1. Make a build directory and cd there:
   > mkdir <embxx_on_rpi_dir>/build
   > cd <embxx_on_rpi_dir>/build
2. Generate makefiles using CMake while defining CROSS_COMPILE prefix:
   > cmake -DCROSS_COMPILE=/opt/arm-none-eabi-2013.05/bin/arm-none-eabi- ..
   
   If CROSS_COMPILE prefix is not defined "arm-none-eabi-" is used and directory 
   containing all the toolchain utilities must be PATH environment variable.
   > cmake ..
   
   Please note that default cmake build type is similar to Debug mode but 
   without any debug simbols in produced binaries. To change the default
   build type please use CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE definition when using cmake utility:
   > cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCROSS_COMPILE=/opt/arm-none-eabi-2013.05/bin/arm-none-eabi- ..
   
   Please refer to CMake documentation for details about its build types
3. Build the binaries:
   > make
   
   For the verbose make output use VERBOSE=1 environment variable:
   > VERBOSE=1 make
4. The image of every compiled application will be:
   <embxx_build_dir>/image/<app_name>/kernel.img
