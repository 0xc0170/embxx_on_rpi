This directory contains sources of this project. See README in "app" directory
for details of what each application does.

The existing directories are:
app - directory of the various applications
asm - common startup (assembler) code for all the applications
device - low level device (peripheral) control classes
stdlib - stub for some stdlib functions. Currently all the applications are 
         compiled without standard library.
