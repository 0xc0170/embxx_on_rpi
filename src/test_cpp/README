This directory contains test applications that are used to inspect output of
the compiler. They should not be used on an actual platform. The applications
are: 

01_test_simple
-----------------
Simple application with infinite loop in main. It's purpose is to see what 
stubs may be required to get the application successfully compiled, and after
the successful compilation to inspect the compiler output.

02_test_vector
-----------------
Application that pushes some values into std::vector. The purpose of this
application is to see what stub functions may be required when dynamic memory
allocation and/or C++ exceptions are used as well as inspect the differences
between C and C++ heaps.

03_test_statics
-----------------
This application defines two static objects, one in the global space and other
inside the accessor function. It should be used to inspect the initialisation
process of these static objects.

04_test_abstract_class
-----------------
The purpose of this application is to analyse what code is generated and get to
know what stub functions are required in case there is abstract class with  
virtual functions (including virtual destructors).

05_test_templates
-----------------
The purpose of this application is to verify the possible code bloating when
templates are used.
